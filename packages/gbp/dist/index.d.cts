 * there are no Places display / caching restrictions.
 *
 * Auth is OAuth user refresh-token, not a service account -- service accounts
 * are rejected by this API entirely. See ./oauth-client.ts.
 *
 * A review's reply has no author field of its own: GBP replies are 1:1 (one
 * slot per review) and always from the business -- there's no third party to
 * disambiguate. Google's own UI renders it as "Response from the owner" for
 * the same reason. Attribute it to the business in the consumer, not here.
 *
 * Access caveat: the Business Profile APIs require a one-time access request
 * / approval from Google, and reviews live on the legacy `mybusiness v4`
 * endpoint which must be enabled on your Cloud project. Until that is
 * granted, every function here degrades gracefully to empty results.
