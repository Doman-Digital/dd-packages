 * RMP-Electrical) route the same entity kinds through different paths --
 * `/services/`, `/electrician/`, `/guides/`, `/team/` vs no team route at
 * all -- and `@id` only has to be a stable identifier, not a resolvable URL.
 * Anchoring at the root removes routing configuration from this package
 * entirely: every consumer gets the same ids with zero setup.
 *
 * `breadcrumb` is the one exception: a BreadcrumbList is inherently
 * page-scoped (one per page), so incorporating the real path is meaningful,
 * not arbitrary.
 *
 * `org` and `website` keep the `#organization` / `#website` convention three
 * independent repos in the portfolio (Doman-Digital, sen-sphere,
 * RMP-Electrical) had already converged on before this package existed.
